# Sudoku
personal project by Jordan Marquis
The goal is to design and implement a sudoku app which can generate, import, and solve puzzles quickly and in slow-motion (to demonstrate solver algorithm).
Users can solve the generated or imported puzzles themselves if desired, using the graphical UI.

Developped using SFML graphics library, in C++.
